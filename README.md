# Candida-omics

🚧 *Work in Progress* 🚧  

This repository contains analysis pipelines and resources for **multi-omic integration** of data from our study on **recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC)** — commonly known as recurrent vaginal yeast infection.  

---

## Background

Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) affects **5%–10% of women**, significantly impacting reproductive health and quality of life.  

An introduction to the cohort and our investigation of bulk transcriptomics data can be found here:

## Data Overview

This repository will bring together multiple omics layers generated from the same cohort, including:

- 🧬 Bulk transcriptomics  
- 🦠 Shotgun metagenome sequencing  
- 💊 Metabolomics  
- 🗺️ Spatial transcriptomics  
- 🩺 Clinical data
